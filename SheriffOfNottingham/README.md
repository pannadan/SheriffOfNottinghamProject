## Inspiration

We all know the benefits of investing in the stock market, however, we don't know where to start. Websites such as Yahoo Finance or apps such as Apple's Stock Market app are daunting to look at for beginners as they contain terminology and data for experts compacted in a small, unaesthetic manner. To fix this barrier to entry for beginners, we decided to create a beginner-friendly stock market website with only the essential (and approachable) information. We hope to be the gateway to get more people interesting in investing, and potentially achieve the financial freedom they hoped to achieve.

P.S. The name is Robinhood's antagonist because we don't support the popular investing website Robinhood due to their alleged market manipulation and ties with big wall street firms.

## What it does

Our website displays financial data regarding the entire stock market and specific stocks.

## How we built it

We built the website using the React framework and through free APIs we found online. To code collaborative, we used VSCode Live Share. Although only one of our members knew React, we decided this hackathon would be a great opportunity to get everybody familiar is such a powerful framework.

## Challenges we ran into

Our two biggest challenges were time and money. Due to other commitments such as swim meets and club meetings, most of our members were not able to code for more than 5 hours in this 24-hour hackathon. However, our biggest limitation was money. Most APIs that would have given us good data were paid and since we decided to keep the project free, the data that we received wasn't to the standard we expected.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have a working website! We have all the functionality we would need to extract data from APIs and display it correctly onto the frontend. If we just get better APIs (which are likely paid) that give better information (eg: as high and low for the year instead of just the hour as we have it now), the website would be able to achieve our vision for what we could be.

## What we learned

Through the project, our group learned how to create and work with tables in React. From extracting a .json file to use for its data and then creating a website presentable enough to display it, our group gained valuable skills in both thinking through the design of the website as well as most of the implementation of our code and ideas as well.

## What's next for The Sheriff of Nottingham (TSN)

The immediate future of TSN lies in better APIs and UI Design. However, in the long term future, we hope to provide beginner-friendly features such as hyperlinks or pop-ups that give the definition of each financial term and has a news section that allows users to "feel" the market conditions instead of just looking at the numbers.
